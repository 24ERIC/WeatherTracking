# üí° idea

WeatherTracting is made by Eric Zhou (from University of Toronto) and Dylan (from Westen University) during Global Hack Week (MLH online hackathon) from Feb.6 - Feb.9 2023. Our team creatively combine multiple advance ML and AI techniques together to actively tracking the weather with a broadcast commentator, a cute animate jumping sheep.


# üèóÔ∏è Process

Firstly, the program collect User Date Input and send it to [Government Weather API](https://weather.gov/) and output a short Forecasting Description. 

Secondly, the program send the Forecasting Description to [DeepAI API](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text-generator) and output a Weather Forecast Speech (text). The team also plan to use send Forecasting Description to [AI Image Generator](https://www.aiimagegenerator.org/) and output a picture as the background for forecasting website.

Thirdly, the program send the Weather Forecast Speech to 



it gives a brief description of weather, for example: Today weather is sunny, temporature is above 30, and moisture is 10%, wind..."
(short description) send to AI, generator a paragraph, and a picture

(paragraph) send to A! generate voice

we also have JS cartoon animate move around when play (voice)


# Examples

## Government Weather API
[JSON file]() 

## Forecasting Description
A slight chance of rain after 5pm. Cloudy. High near 53, with temperatures falling to around 51 in the afternoon. Southeast wind 7 to 12 mph. Chance of precipitation is 20%.
