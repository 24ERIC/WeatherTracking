# Basic idea

Basic idea is: we use past weather data to predict future weather, and then it gives a brief description of weather, for example: Today weather is sunny, temporature is above 30, and moisture is 10%, wind..."
(short description) send to AI, generator a paragraph, and a picture

(paragraph) send to A! generate voice

we also have JS cartoon animate move around when play (voice)


# Design of website

For the display of website, basic version is : only a JS cartoon with a AI generate picture background, and a date select window.

advance version: multiple button include today weather, tomorrow weather, reset AI picture, reset AI picture
